# Amazon CloudFront Secure and powerful architecture for Static Website

Use this solution to create a secure static website for your registered domain name. With this solution, your website:

- Is hosted on [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
- Is distributed by [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)
- Uses an SSL/TLS certificate from [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/)
- Uses [CloudFront Response Header Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-response-headers.html) to add security headers to every server response

For more information about each of these components, see the **Solution details** section on this page.
